## 30-Second Skim (Abstract + Figures)

**What's the claim?** (One line)
For whole body skills, follow up the training in simulation with a training run on data collected from deployed hardware in order to learn the sim-to-real gap and bridge it.

**The figure that tells the story:** (Figure #)


**Task domain:** [ ] Manipulation  [x] Locomotion  [ ] Navigation  [ ] Multi-task  [ ] Other: ___

## Relevance Filter

| Relevant to... | Yes/No | How? |
|----------------|--------|------|
| VLA / embodied AI |  |  |
| Motor control / low-level |  |  |
| Sim2Real | Yes | Delta-model learning based approach to zeroing the sim-to-real gap |
| Data efficiency |  |  |
| My current problem: ___ |  |  |

## Quality Signals (Flip through)

- [x] Real robot results (not just sim)
- [ ] Ablations present
- [x] Code released
- [x] Comparisons to recent (<2 yr) baselines
- [x] Clear failure cases shown

**Red flags spotted:**
The limitations section is a bit discouraging.

## Gut Check

**Novelty:** [x] Incremental  [ ] Solid contribution  [ ] Potentially big idea

**Could I explain the core idea right now?** [ ] Yes  [x] Vaguely  [ ] No (complexity signal)

**One thing that made me curious:**
Delta modeling or method for learning this sim-to-real delta using deployement is broadly interesting

## Verdict

[ ] **DEEP READ** - High relevance, worth 2+ hours
[x] **SKIM** - Grab the technique, skip details  
[ ] **ARCHIVE** - Reference later if needed
[ ] **SKIP** - Not for me right now

**If reading, focus on Section(s):**
