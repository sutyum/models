## 30-Second Skim (Abstract + Figures)

**What's the claim?** (One line)
Humanoids can achieve greater agility by co-designing controller and hardware design. They demonstrate an agile humanoid design - co-designed using centroid dynamics modeling (Centroidal Inertia Isotropy and Centroidal momentum matrix).


**The figure that tells the story:** (Figure #)
Figure 5: The comparison of CoM and momentum of inertia change based on different design principles


**Task domain:** [ ] Manipulation  [x] Locomotion  [ ] Navigation  [ ] Multi-task  [x] Other: Hardware Design

## Quality Signals (Flip through)

- [x] Real robot results (not just sim)
- [ ] Ablations present
- [ ] Code released
- [ ] Comparisons to recent (<2 yr) baselines
- [ ] Clear failure cases shown

**Red flags spotted:**
Its very short and doesn't explain too much about the co-design process.

## Gut Check

**Novelty:** [x] Incremental  [ ] Solid contribution  [ ] Potentially big idea

**Could I explain the core idea right now?** [x] Yes  [ ] Vaguely  [ ] No (complexity signal)

**One thing that made me curious:**
The co-design methods like CII, SLIP, and centroidal momentum matrix.

## Verdict

[x] **DEEP READ** - High relevance, worth 2+ hours
[ ] **SKIM** - Grab the technique, skip details  
[ ] **ARCHIVE** - Reference later if needed
[ ] **SKIP** - Not for me right now
